# applet-BBCRadio
Listen to BBC Radio live and listen again streams on your Squeezebox.  Live radio and the last 7 days of BBC national, regional and local radio from the UK.

This applet is written by Triode and is imported from his old repository on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/triodeapplets/). After Google Code shut down its service Triode's plugins and applets got a temporary home on http://triodeplugins.herger.net/ which has now been migrated to LMS-Community.
